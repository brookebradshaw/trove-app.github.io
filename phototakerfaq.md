# Frequently asked questions for photo takers

**How do I download the app?**

If you have signed up, our team at Microsoft will send you an email with instructions to download and install the app on your iOS or Android device.

If you haven't signed up - please [sign up here](https://aka.ms/trytrove). You will need a Microsoft account and may have to enter your Google ID if you use an Android device.

**I signed up, but never received an email from the Trove team**

Please contact us at [projecttrovehelp@microsoft.com](mailto:projecttrovehelp@microsoft.com)

**I use an iPhone. I received the invite email for Trove. What do I do next?**

**iPhone users** – you will need to download the Apple TestFlight app during the process

1.	You should have received an email directly from Apple inviting you to test Trove. Open this email on your phone and then click on the link 
2.	Follow the instructions from the TestFlight app to install Trove
3.	After you install the app, you will then sign in to the app with the consumer email you provided (usually @hotmail.com or @outlook.com)

*Install worked?*

Great! You can start using Trove and contributing to projects. 
 
*Something went wrong? Here are a few troubleshooting steps:* 

1. I don’t see Trove in the list inside TestFlight – Make sure you signed in to the TestFlight app with the same Apple ID you provided us
2. I get an error while downloading – Please send a screenshot to [projecttrovehelp@microsoft.com](projecttrovehelp@microsoft.com) 
3. I get an error saying that Trove is only available to people 18 years of age and older – This is related to your Microsoft account / Microsoft consumer email and what age you have declared in that account. Check that you've entered the right birthdate at [https://account.microsoft.com](https://account.microsoft.com)

**I use an Android device. I received the invite email for Trove. What do I do next?**

**Android users** – From your phone, navigate to this link on your phone to see the install page on the Google Play store. This is how Google manages all beta testers.  

Then:
1.	Install the app from the page 
2.	Trove should now be in your home/ other screens 
3.	After you install the app, you will then sign into the app with the consumer email you provided (usually @hotmail.com or @outlook.com)

Check that you've entered the right birthdate at [https://account.microsoft.com](https://account.microsoft.com)


**How do I sign in to the app?**

Make sure you’re signing into the app using the consumer Microsoft email (usually @hotmail.com or @outlook.com, but can be any email address) you provided. You will use the password that is associated with this email address. 

**Why is an alert about my age preventing me from signing in?**

You must be at least 18 years of age to use Trove. The app recognizes the age you have declared in your Microsoft consumer email (usually @outlook.com or @hotmail.com). If you’ve verified your age by checking it at [https://account.microsoft.com](https://account.microsoft.com) and are still getting an error when you try to sign in, please email us for help at [projecttrovehelp@microsoft.com](mailto:projecttrovehelp@microsoft.com).

**How do I upload photos to a folder and share a link to a folder?**

Please follow the steps here: [Sharing a link to your photos in Project Trove](https://trove-app.github.io/submitlinktophotos)

**How do I give feedback on or ask a question about a project?**
In the app, you can Ask a question using the button on the project page. This will pop up an email to the project owner where you can ask your question.

**I've sent some photos. When and how will I know if my photos are approved?**

You won’t be informed instantly if your photos are approved. AI developers usually gather a certain amount of photos first and then review them at one time. Depending on when your photo(s) have been submitted, it could take up to a few weeks to hear back. 

You’ll know that your photos were approved when you receive a notification from the app that they were approved. You’re also able to see the status of your photo submissions by going into the My projects section. There, you’ll see if your submission(s) are Pending or Approved. 

Along the way, you’re always welcome to reach out to the project owner for clarification or questions. 

**When will I know if I won in the sweepstakes?**

You will be entered to win in a sweepstakes for each photo that meets a project’s requirements. There will be three different drawings between May and August 2020, and you will be emailed if you win. If you have questions about your entries, you can email [projecttrovehelp@microsoft.com](mailto:projecttrovehelp@microsoft.com). Please also refer to the [sweepstakes terms and conditions](/Trove Limited Preview Sweepstakes Official Rules.pdf).
